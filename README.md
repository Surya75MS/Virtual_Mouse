Computer vision and ML are the technologies that is revolutionising the technology space off late and we present a technique of using these technologies to redefine the way we use mouse. We attempted to manifest human-computer interaction by being able to control mouse pointer of our system using hand gestures. We have used MediaPipe ML algorithm developed by Google which is aimed at providing solutions for computer vision applications. This approach does not require any external tools for successful implementation as it uses the inbuilt webcam of our laptop. We could implement various mouse operations like left click, right click and scrolling functionalities by tracking various hand gestures with the help of MediaPipe ML algorithm.
